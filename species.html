                <h2>Species</h2>
                <p>In biodiversity, species are grouped into various types based on their ecological roles,
                    interactions, evolutionary history, and impact on their environments. Here’s a detailed breakdown of
                    key types of species in biodiversity:</p>
                <br>
                <h3>1. Endemic Species</h3>
                <p>Species that are found only in a specific geographic area and nowhere else in the world.
                    <br>Examples: The lemurs of Madagascar, the Galápagos tortoises, and Australia’s kangaroos.
                    <br>Importance: They often evolve unique traits due to isolation and can be especially vulnerable to
                    extinction if their habitats are disturbed.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Native Species </h3>
                <p> Species that naturally occur and have evolved in a particular ecosystem or region.
                    Examples: The American bison in North America, the African elephant in Africa, and the baobab tree
                    in Madagascar.
                    <br>Importance: Native species form the backbone of ecosystems and have complex relationships with
                    other local species, contributing to ecological stability.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>3. Exotic (Non-Native) Species</h3>
                Species introduced to a new habitat where they did not originally evolve. Often introduced by human
                activity. <br>
                Examples: The European starling in North America, eucalyptus trees in California, and kudzu in the
                southeastern United States.
                <br> Importance: While some non-native species integrate without issues, others can disrupt ecosystems
                by outcompeting native species, leading to invasive species problems.</p>
                <p>
                <h3> 4. Invasive Species </h3>
                Non-native species that spread rapidly in a new environment, often causing harm to native species,
                habitats, or human interests.
                <br> Examples: Zebra mussels in North American lakes, the cane toad in Australia, and water hyacinth in
                African lakes.
                <br>Impact: Invasive species can lead to the decline or extinction of native species, alter habitats,
                and disrupt ecosystems. They can also cause significant economic and environmental costs.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>5. Indicator Species</h3>
                Species whose presence, absence, or health reflects the quality or changes in environmental conditions.
                <br>Examples: Frogs and amphibians are indicators of water quality; lichens are indicators of air
                pollution levels.
                <br>Importance: Monitoring indicator species helps scientists assess ecosystem health and detect early
                signs of environmental change, such as pollution or climate change impacts.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>6. Keystone Species</h3>
                Species that play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecosystem, disproportionately
                influencing other species and ecosystem processes.
                <br>Examples: Sea otters in kelp forests (they control sea urchin populations), wolves in Yellowstone
                (which regulate herbivores), and beavers (which create wetlands by building dams).
                <br>Importance: The removal of a keystone species can lead to significant ecosystem collapse, loss of
                biodiversity, or drastic changes in habitat structure.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>7. Umbrella Species</h3>
                Large-ranging species whose conservation also protects many other species within the same habitat.
                <br>Examples: The Bengal tiger in Asia, the grizzly bear in North America, and the giant panda in China.
                <br>Importance: Protecting umbrella species often involves conserving large areas of habitat, which
                benefits numerous other species that share the environment.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>8. Flagship Species</h3>
                Species chosen as symbols or ambassadors for conservation efforts, often because of their charisma or
                appeal to the public.
                <br>Examples: African elephants, giant pandas, and polar bears.
                <br>Importance: Flagship species are used to rally public support and funding for broader conservation
                projects, helping to protect ecosystems and other species indirectly.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>
                    9. Foundation Species</h3>
                Species that create or define a particular habitat, allowing other species to inhabit the ecosystem.
                <br>Examples: Corals in coral reefs, kelp in kelp forests, and certain types of trees in forests.
                <br>Importance: Foundation species form the primary structure of an ecosystem, providing habitat and
                resources essential for many other species. Their loss can lead to the collapse of the entire ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>10. Endangered and Threatened Species</h3>
                Species that are at risk of extinction due to factors such as habitat loss, pollution, overhunting, or
                climate change. Endangered species are at a higher risk, while threatened species are likely to become
                endangered in the near future.
                <br>Examples: The Sumatran orangutan, black rhino, and many amphibian species.
                <br>Importance: Conservation of these species is crucial to maintaining biodiversity and the health of
                ecosystems, as the loss of a species can have cascading effects throughout the environment.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>11. Alien Species</h3>
                Species introduced from one region to another, often through human activities, intentionally or
                accidentally.
                <br>Examples: The common carp introduced worldwide, the American grey squirrel in the UK, and the brown
                tree snake in Guam.
                <br>Importance: Alien species can be harmless in some cases, but they can become invasive, causing harm
                to native species and ecosystems.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>12. Extinct Species</h3>
                Species that no longer exist anywhere on Earth. Extinctions can occur naturally, but human activities
                have accelerated extinction rates.
                <br>Examples: The dodo, the passenger pigeon, and the Tasmanian tiger.
                <br>Importance: Extinct species serve as reminders of the impact of environmental and human factors on
                biodiversity and underscore the need for conservation.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>13. Bioindicator Species</h3>
                Species that help indicate the health of an ecosystem by showing visible signs of ecological change or
                pollution.
                <br>Examples: Honeybees (for ecosystem health and pollination), certain fish species (indicate water
                pollution levels), and stoneflies (water quality).
                <br>Importance: Bioindicator species are essential for monitoring environmental health and detecting
                ecosystem disturbances early on.
                Understanding these types of species helps scientists, policymakers, and the public make informed
                conservation decisions, protect critical habitats, and maintain the ecological balance needed for life
                on Earth.</p>
