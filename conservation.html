        benefit from biodiversity and have a vested interest in preserving it.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>5. Species-Specific Conservation Programs</h3>
        Captive Breeding and Reintroduction: Programs to breed endangered species in captivity and release them into
        their natural habitats, such as the California condor recovery program.
        <br>Habitat Restoration: Restores degraded ecosystems, such as replanting native trees, removing invasive
        species, or rebuilding coral reefs.
        <br>Genetic Conservation: Seed banks and genetic repositories protect genetic diversity, allowing species to
        adapt to future changes and recover from population loss.
        <br>Benefits: These targeted approaches help save critically endangered species and restore habitats, promoting
        overall ecosystem recovery.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>6. Habitat Restoration and Reforestation</h3>
        Restoring Degraded Ecosystems: Rehabilitation of forests, wetlands, and grasslands restores biodiversity and
        promotes ecosystem services like water filtration and carbon storage.
        <br>Reforestation and Afforestation: Planting native trees helps expand forests, stabilize soil, and restore
        natural habitats, supporting species that rely on forest ecosystems.
        <br>Urban Greening: Creating green spaces, parks, and wildlife corridors in urban areas to support local
        biodiversity and connect fragmented habitats.
        <br>Benefits: Restored ecosystems improve biodiversity, resilience to climate change, and quality of life for
        human communities.</p>
        <p>
        <h3> 7. Climate Change Mitigation</h3>
        Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Cutting emissions from fossil fuels to slow climate change, which is a major
        driver of habitat loss and biodiversity threats.
        <br>Carbon Sequestration: Forests, wetlands, and soils absorb CO₂, so protecting and restoring these areas helps
        combat climate change and maintain biodiversity.
        <br>Adaptation Strategies for Species: Creating migration corridors or assisted migration for species at risk
        from climate change impacts.
        <br>Benefits: Climate action is essential for long-term biodiversity conservation, as it prevents drastic
        changes in ecosystems that disrupt species survival.</p>
        <p>
